# Pipeline is a sequence of entry, zero or more filters, and exit,
# but yamale - and YAML - lacks a method of forcing sequence order.
# Therefore,
#   - have three required elements in the map, entry, filters, exit
#   - inclusion of filters is optional; if included, their order is
#     defined by an 'order' number
#   - have code know about the sequence and "do the right thing",
#     mapping from n-1's types to n's, etc.
